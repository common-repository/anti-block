Alert your visitors that they are using ad-blocking software and present them with a nice message telling them to switch it off for your site.

== Description ==

I created this plugin initially because I noticed that some ad-blocking software was blocking more than just my ads, they were also blocking random elements on my site like my image sliders as well. But obviously this will serve the guys who want it just for the purpose of notifying visitors who block ads to stop doing so.

This plugin displays a nice notice to them explaining the situation.
The interface has two options, the okay button will reload the page upon clicking it (hopefully they would have disabled ad-block), the other button will simply close the message box. If the option to stop nagging visitors for the entire duration of their session on your website is set, then upon clicking the decline button, the message will only show again next time they visit your website.

== Installation ==

This plugin is easy to install, just do the following.

1. Unzip the plugin to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Amend the plugin settings under Settings --> Anti-block


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin add to my page load time? =

No, this plugin only runs when the footer of the page is loaded, by then all your content would have been loaded already.

= Can I make my the visitor's screen explode when they block my ads? =

Sadly, no :-(

== Screenshots ==

1. Example of settings screen where you edit plugin settings.
2. Example of how the message looks when showed to a visitor of your website.
